# Case Study on Titanic dataset
Using Titanic dataset find out
information about how many male survived who had cabin and age is less than 50.
Also show graphical representation of male and female survived and dead in the
tragedy.   (LO6)
# Exp-1.Basics of Python:
## a)	Write a python program to swap two numbers and check if the first number is positive, negative or zero.
## b)	Write a python program to print all the numbers divisible by 4 in the range 1 to n (use for loop).
## c)	Write a python program to find the factorial of an input number (use while loop).
## d)	Write a menu-driven python program to build simple calculator functions.
## e)	Write a python program to display Fibonacci series of n number.
# Exp-2. Advanced Data types and functions in Python:
## A. Write a python program to perform following operations on an array: Sum of all even elements, count the no. of elements divisible by 3, insert 2 elements at the end of the list, delete all the odd elements from the list.
## B. Write a python program to input a multiline string or a paragraph & count the no. of words & characters in string. Also check for a substring & replace each of its occurrences by some other string.
## C. Python program for finding a power of a given number using Recursive Method. Python Program for printing Fibonacci Number using Recursive method.
## D. Write AIM, Theory, Program and Output in the same document.
Please make pdf and upload.(xie id , name should be in header)
write down the algorithm In the theory.
## E. Write a menu-driven program to demonstrate the use of set in
python:
i) Accept two strings from the user.
ii) Display common letters in two input strings (set
intersection).
iii) Display letters which are in the first string but not in
the second string (set difference).
iv) Display set of all letters from both the strings (set
union).
v) Display set of letters which are in two strings but not
common (Symmetric Difference).
## F. Write a menu-driven program to demonstrate the use of dictionary in
python:
i) Create key/value pair dictionary.
ii) Update/concatenate and delete item from existing
dictionary.
iii) Find a key and print its value.
# Exp-3: Object Oriented Programming in Python:
Design an person/employee / account class
using python for reading & displaying the employee information.

Write python programs to understand

a)         Classes,
Objects, Constructors, Inner class and Static method

b)         Different
types of Inheritance

c)         Polymorphism
using Operator overloading, Method overloading, Method overriding, Abstract
class, Abstract method and Interfaces in Python.

# Exp-4:Python applications using modules, packages, multithreading and exception handling
Write python
programs to understand

a)     
Creating User-defined
modules/packages and import them in a program

b)     
Creating user defined
multithreaded application with thread synchronization and deadlocks

Creating a menu driven application which should
cover all the exceptions in python.
