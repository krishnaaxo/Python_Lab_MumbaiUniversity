# Case Study on Titanic dataset
Using Titanic dataset find out
information about how many male survived who had cabin and age is less than 50.
Also show graphical representation of male and female survived and dead in the
tragedy.   (LO6)
# Exp-1.Basics of Python:
## a)	Write a python program to swap two numbers and check if the first number is positive, negative or zero.
## b)	Write a python program to print all the numbers divisible by 4 in the range 1 to n (use for loop).
## c)	Write a python program to find the factorial of an input number (use while loop).
## d)	Write a menu-driven python program to build simple calculator functions.
## e)	Write a python program to display Fibonacci series of n number.
# Exp-2. Advanced Data types and functions in Python:
## A. Write a python program to perform following operations on an array: Sum of all even elements, count the no. of elements divisible by 3, insert 2 elements at the end of the list, delete all the odd elements from the list.
## B. Write a python program to input a multiline string or a paragraph & count the no. of words & characters in string. Also check for a substring & replace each of its occurrences by some other string.
## C. Python program for finding a power of a given number using Recursive Method. Python Program for printing Fibonacci Number using Recursive method.
## D. Write AIM, Theory, Program and Output in the same document.
Please make pdf and upload.(xie id , name should be in header)
write down the algorithm In the theory.
## E. Write a menu-driven program to demonstrate the use of set in
python:
i) Accept two strings from the user.
ii) Display common letters in two input strings (set
intersection).
iii) Display letters which are in the first string but not in
the second string (set difference).
iv) Display set of all letters from both the strings (set
union).
v) Display set of letters which are in two strings but not
common (Symmetric Difference).
## F. Write a menu-driven program to demonstrate the use of dictionary in
python:
i) Create key/value pair dictionary.
ii) Update/concatenate and delete item from existing
dictionary.
iii) Find a key and print its value.
# Exp-3: Object Oriented Programming in Python:
Design an person/employee / account class
using python for reading & displaying the employee information.

Write python programs to understand

a)         Classes,
Objects, Constructors, Inner class and Static method

b)         Different
types of Inheritance

c)         Polymorphism
using Operator overloading, Method overloading, Method overriding, Abstract
class, Abstract method and Interfaces in Python.

# Exp-4:Python applications using modules, packages, multithreading and exception handling
Write python
programs to understand

a)     
Creating User-defined
modules/packages and import them in a program

b)     
Creating user defined
multithreaded application with thread synchronization and deadlocks

Creating a menu driven application which should
cover all the exceptions in python.
# Assignment-1
Write a python program to input a string, remove
punctuation from a string and then sort words in alphabetic order. (LO1)
# Assignment-2
Write the following programs (LO2)

i)       
Write a python program to count tuples occurrences
in given list of tuples and then remove duplicate tuples from list of tuples

ii)     
Write a python program to create a sub-dictionary
containing all keys from dictionary list
Class comments
# Assignment-3
Create a Vehicle class with max_speed and mileage
instance attributes. Create a Bus and Taxi classes that inherit the Vehicle
class. Give the capacity argument of Bus. The seating_capacity() for bus and
Taxi a default value of 50 and 3 respectively. The default fare charge of any
vehicle is seating capacity * 100 per 5km. If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need
to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. So total fare for bus
instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.
Calculate total fare charges spent by group for picnic if both taxi and bus is
used for travelling 100km distance one way.  (LO3)
# Assignment-4
Create
module for performing mathematical function and import it to calculate
Euclidean distance. Show exception handling to handle the runtime mistake done
by user. (LO4)
# Assignment-5
Develop GUI Application for E-commerce
application use (LO5)

1) file, pickle, dictionary  to show add, delete, update operations.

2) sqlite3 dictionary  to show add, delete, update operations.
